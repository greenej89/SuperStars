# Super Stars

## Description

This application was a solo project that I completed during my coding bootcamp. Super Stars is an interactive and easy-to-use reward chart for young children. I included a feature to use the app in either kid mode and grown-up mode. In kid mode, the user can only view star charts. In grown-up mode, the user can view star charts, add kids, add goals, and award stars.

## How to Use Super Stars
After pulling the git repo, navigate to the client directory and run:
npm install
npm start

In a second terminal, navigate to the server directory and run:
node server.js

At this point, you should be able to use the program locally in your browser at: 
http://localhost:3000/

HINT: Click the "Show Access Code" button at the bottom of the screen, and type the access code in the input field to enable "grown-up mode."
